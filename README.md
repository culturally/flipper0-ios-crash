# Flipper0-iOS-Crash  
**Educational Ducky Script to Demonstrate Bluetooth Exploitation on iOS Devices**  

## **Description**  
This repository provides a Ducky Script designed for the Flipper Zero, enabling a Bluetooth-based attack to crash iOS devices. By using the "Bad BT" (Bluetooth) approach, this script leverages a specific "exploit"(spam) that crashes devices running iOS versions <18.2.  

**Disclaimer: This script is intended solely for educational and awareness purposes.**  
It demonstrates the dangers of outdated firmware and vulnerabilities. Misuse of this script for illegal activities is strictly prohibited. Always test responsibly and with prior consent from the device owner.  

---

## **Features**  
- Demonstrates how malformed inputs can cause system instability via Bluetooth.  
- Compatible with the Flipper Zero for easy deployment and execution.  

---

## **How It Works**  
The included Ducky Script executes a series of commands intended to overwhelm and exploit weaknesses in the target device's input system, leading to a crash. Below is a breakdown of the script:  

1. **Initial Steps:**  
   - The script starts by opening a spotlight-like search using `GUI h`, followed by `GUI SPACE`, to ensure the target system's attention is redirected to running commands.  

2. **Triggering the Crash:**  
   - The script simulates a repeated, rapid combination of inputs (`GUI-SHIFT 4`) with precise timing (`DELAY 1`) to overload the iOS Bluetooth stack.  
   - The repetitive input triggers a buffer overflow or resource exhaustion, causing the device to become unresponsive or crash.  

3. **Final Outcome:**  
   - The device's crash or restart occurs due to the vulnerability in processing repeated malformed inputs through Bluetooth channels.

## **Prerequisites**  
1. A Flipper Zero device capable of running Ducky Scripts.  
2. Knowledge of transferring and executing scripts on the Flipper Zero.  
3. An iOS device

## **Usage**  
1. **Transfer the Script:**  
   - Copy the provided `payload.txt` to the Flipper Zeroâ€™s storage.  
   - Ensure Bluetooth is enabled on the Flipper Zero.  

2. **Execution:**  
   - Open the Ducky Script file on the Flipper Zero.  
   - Execute the script in proximity to a target device (within Bluetooth range).  

3. **Testing Ethically:**  
   - Ensure you have explicit permission from the device owner before testing.

## **Recommendations for Users**  
- **Update iOS Firmware:** Always keep your iOS devices updated to avoid vulnerabilities like this.  
- **Limit Bluetooth Use:** Disable Bluetooth when not actively using it to reduce exposure to potential exploits.  
- **Monitor Bluetooth Activity:** Be cautious of unknown devices attempting to connect or interact.
